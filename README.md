# GoEdit - A bare bones text editor, written in Go

For this project I will be using [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go),
a minimalistic API for text-based user interfaces.

My objective is to create a simple text editor, like [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)),
with the base functionality

- [Supported commands](https://github.com/AlejandroSuero/GoEdit#supported-commands)

## Installation

To start using this editor, first thing you need is to install **Go** -> [golang's official site](https://go.dev/).

Once **Go** is installed, go to your terminal clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroSuero/GoEdit
```

> Note: If you don't have git installed, go to -> [git's official site](https://git-scm.com/) or select at the top where it is a green button that says "Code â–¼" and next "Download ZIP".

Next, go into the directory where you have it cloned.

```bash
# This will initialize the project
go init goedit

# This will download the dependencies
go mod tidy
```

Finally, you can build the project and start using it.

```bash
# For UNIX users
go build -o goedit editor.go
./goedit <path-to-the-file-or-leave-it-empty-for-a-welcome-message>

# For Windows users
go build -o goedit.exe editor.go
.\goedit.exe <path-to-the-file-or-leave-it-empty-for-a-welcome-message>
```

For now, check the commands and GoEdit those files ðŸ«¡
